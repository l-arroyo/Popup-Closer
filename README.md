# Popup Window Closer

This Python script helps you automatically close ComponentOne license popup windows. Simply run the script and keep it open while compiling your solution and let it close all these annoying popup windows for you.

## Getting Started

To use this script, you need to install the required dependencies listed in `dependencies.txt`:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the base directory of the repo.

2. Install the dependencies using pip by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies, including libraries for interacting with the windows.

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the script to start closing popup windows by executing:

```bash
python main.py
```

(Just keep the script running in the background and it will attempt to close all the popups)
